"I'm sitting in a dark tube of humans."

That's what was going through my head when the pilot announced that he'd be power cycling the airplane to solve a computer glitch prior to takeoff. To those of you unfamiliar with engineering parlance, power cycling is the act of turning off a system and turning it back on. Yes, it's as basic as it sounds. Yes, you've probably done it before.

And yes, it does seem to work in a lot of cases.

There's a reason I'm coasting along at 26,000 feet somewhere over the Eastern seaboard in this dark tube of humans. I'm homeward bound for the weekend to catch up with some true friends and make sure that my old stomping grounds remain properly stomped. It's a great chance to turn everything off and get away for a few days. In a way, I'm power cycling myself just as much as this Shuttle America E-170.

I've actually been wanting to get this blog up for a while, and the very first version of it was actually my very first foray into web development during my sophomore year of college. I've been meaning to rebuild one and never seemed to get around to it — the perfectionist in me saw to that.

Lately I've been watching a lot of [Casey Neistat's stuff on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat). If you haven't, go check it out. It started with his dope Aladdin Magic Carpet Prank for Halloween last year, and after noticing that pretty much every building in the video was around the block from my apartment I started paying closer attention to his daily uploads.

Anyway, his work ethic inspired me to get back on the blogging horse and start writing in earnest – to turn it all back on again. After six months of engineering work at LinkedIn, it's become more apparent to me that I shouldn't worry about the perfect stylesheet or blogging engine. I picked [Poet](https://github.com/jsantell/poet/) for now and I'm going to iterate like crazy to straighten out the kinks.

Let's get to work.
