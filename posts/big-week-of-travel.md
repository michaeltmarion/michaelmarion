I haven't procrastinated like this since college.

I've been doing really well lately. I'm taking much better care of myself: I've cut back somewhat on the alcohol intake, I'm exercising daily, I'm minding my diet, and doing a better job of sticking to a few habits. I'm down twenty pounds and am nowhere near finished on this health kick.

Given this newfound discipline, why am I sitting here in my room working on my personal website instead of packing for the big-ass *fly-to-North-Carolina-for-a-weekend-then-to-San-Francisco-for-a-week-then-back-to-North-Carolina-then-drive-to-Virginia-then-drive-back-then-fly-back-to-Manhattan* trip that commences tomorrow?

I finally got this damned Poet library to function, at least somewhat. And when I have a breakthrough, I kind of try and push as hard as I can to squeeze every bit of inspiration out of it as I can. As my coworker Joel would put it, it's been a hot mess to get Poet singing alongside the Express framework. The breakthrough came when I noticed I should be instantiating the Poet object in the application file, not the routes file. Anyway, it's all working swimmingly at the moment, save for the strange bug that duplicates the body of my posts. That's one for the plane tomorrow.

And Caesar wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.
